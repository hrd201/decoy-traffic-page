# Infringement Monitor Compliance

## Scope
Design and run a compliance-first monitoring pipeline for suspected product infringement.

## Hard Boundary
Do not provide anti-bot bypass, captcha circumvention, fingerprint spoofing, stealth automation, or reverse-engineering tactics that violate platform controls.

## Workflow
1. Define monitored brands/SKUs/keywords.
2. Collect signals from authorized or compliant sources only.
3. Score risk with text/image/entity/price features.
4. Preserve evidence with timestamp + immutable snapshot.
5. Produce daily/weekly enforcement report.

## Deliverables
- Monitoring rule set
- Risk scoring table
- Evidence checklist
- Escalation SOP (ops → legal)
